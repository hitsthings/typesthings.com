## Past projects

These are things I don't really touch anymore, but I'm still proud of.

### [Atlassian Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise/data-center)

I worked on the frontend of this product since it was called Stash (after the `git stash` command). Many people contributed to make this a wonderful product, but I'm very proud to have been the largest influence on the frontend codebase, acting as architect to keep the codebase maintainable, to provide a small but powerful set of add-on APIs, and to keep the codebase accessible to new developers. Our codebase had a reputation in Atlassian as the best engineered and maintainable codebase in the company.  My technical influence waned when I became a Team Lead, but my product influence waxed. It was great helping to shape the features we shipped. I will always look back on the early days of building Stash as some of the best years of my professional career.

### [Redux Packet](https://github.com/hitsthings/redux-packet)

A mechanism to deliver Redux state in logical groupings, rather than each UI component selecting directly from state. I spent a chunk of time on this, then React Hooks were released and I went off and spent time elsewhere instead. Still a good libbrary for more maintainable Redux.

### [Istanbul Proxy](https://github.com/hitsthings/istanbul-proxy)

A proxy that injects Istanbul coverage instrumentation into your JS, so that you can run tests with coverage information, even if you can't add Istanbul into your build pipeline.

### [Multi-slider Range](https://github.com/hitsthings/multi-slider-range)

A component that looks like a native [`input[type="range"]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) but can have multiple sliders running across it. This allows it to be used for things like setting min and max values.
